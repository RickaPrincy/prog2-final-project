# RPM
RPM is a simple API project manager for basic usage. In the future (perhaps), there will be an interface for it. However, for the moment, it is just a simple REST API.

# Getting Started

- Create the database using the [migration file](src/main/resources/migrations/migration.sql).
- That's it! You are now able to run the server.
